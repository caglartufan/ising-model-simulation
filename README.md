# Ising Model Simulation

## :pencil: About the project

This is my physics license thesis project. In this project I programmed Ising model and simulated it, generated output images for different parameters. Ising model is a model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics. Aimed output of this simulation is to show that magnetism of a material or atomic spin system tends to lower as the temperature of the system increases.
